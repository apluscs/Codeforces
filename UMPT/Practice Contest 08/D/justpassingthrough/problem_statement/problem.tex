\problemname{Just Passing Through}
Justin and Fred are taking a road trip, traveling from West to East
across their state. They have a few Road Trip Rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item They must have an awesome time!
\item The trip must begin somewhere along the Western edge of the state
and finish somewhere along the Eastern edge of the state.
\item Each step in their trip must move them either directly East,
diagonally Northeast, or diagonally Southeast.
\item They want to travel through exactly $n$ ``passes'' (defined below).
\item Due to Fred's sensitivity to higher elevations, they wish to minimize
the cumulative sum of elevations during the trip.
\item They must have an awesome time!
\end{enumerate}
Because Justin and Fred are traveling Eastward, a ``pass'' is any location
with strictly lower elevations to its East and West and strictly higher
elevations to its North and South. Consider the elevation map 
shown in Figure \ref{fig1:just}.
Undrivable locations (either due to water or stubborn insistence on
staying in-state) are shown in black, while passes are shown as gray.
Locations adjacent to the border or to undrivable locations are not
eligible for considerations as passes.

\section*{Input}
The input begins with three integers $r$ $c$ $n$ representing the
number of rows and columns in the representation of the state's topography
($3 \leq r, c \leq 500$) and the exact number of passes to be crossed
($0 \leq n \leq 10$). The next $r$ lines each contain
$c$ elevation entries. Undrivable locations are represented by
$-1$, and all other elevations are between $0$ and $1\, 000$. There is
guaranteed to be at least one drivable location on both the Eastern and
Western borders.

\section*{Output}
Output the sum of the elevations along the optimal path which satisfies
the Road Trip Rules. If no such path exists, output \texttt{impossible}.
